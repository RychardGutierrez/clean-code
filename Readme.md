# Clean Code

- It's not about whether code works
- A vast majority of time is spent reading and understanding code.
- Should be readable and meaningful
- Should reducce cognotive load
- Should be concise and the point
- Should abcoud unintuitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks
- Should follow common best practices and patterns
- Should be fun to write and to maintain
 
Clean code is easy to understand --- Dirty code is not
